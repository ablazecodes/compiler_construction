# Compiler Construction and TOC Programs
### Description
Programs in the domain of Compiler Construction and Automata Formal Language. Where, AFL is the language through which we do computation, generally on a string or a set of strings defined on a grammar. 
Examples of some programs included in this repo are 
* Program to check a string under a given grammar
* Program to check for keywords in a given string
* Program to check for keyword in a file (modified program 2)
* Program to make deterministic finite automata, DFA

### Running the code
Any IDE with the support of CPP (C++) language will be compatible. I used VS Code and MinGW for the same purpose
